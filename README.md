Face Recognition Based Attendance System
1 System Architecture
The system architecture consists of the following main components:

1.	Face Detection Module: Identifies and locates faces in images.
2.	Face Recognition Module: Matches detected faces with pre-trained face embedding.
3.	Database: Stores information about registered individuals and their attendance records.
4.	User Interface: Provides an interactive interface for system management and monitoring.

2 Workflow
1.	Face Registration: Capture and register faces of individuals into the system.
2.	Model Training: Train the face recognition model using the registered faces.
3.	Attendance Tracking: Detect and recognize faces in real-time to log attendance.
4.	User Management: Administer the system through the user interface.
